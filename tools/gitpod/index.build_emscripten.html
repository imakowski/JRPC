<h4>Welcome to the interactive playground.</h4>
<br/>
This interactive playground uses emscripten: all the C++ code is compiled into javascript, so that you
can test everything from the browser.
<br/><br/>
At the bottom, of the window, you will see 3 terminals

<ul>
    <li/> A terminal named "http.server": it runs a web server on the port 8000.
    The text you are reading (i.e this text) is located on a page of this web server.
    <li/> A terminal name "build": the code should have already started to build automatically in this terminal.
    <li/> A terminal named "main": use it to run any command
</ul>

Wait until the build is finished (the first build takes about 1 minute) and you will then be able to run:

<ul>
    <li/> The Example Apps from imgui_demo.cpp in the folder <a href="playground/ExampleApps" target="_blank">playground/ExampleApps</a>
    <li/> The examples in the <a href="playground/" target="_blank">playground folder</a>.
    You can quickly test any feature using the playground. See playground/Readme.md for more info.
    <li/> The imgui manual at <a href="src/imgui_manual.html" target="_blank">src/imgui_manual.html</a>
</ul>

<h4>How to use the playground</h4>

You can quickly add a new program by adding a new cpp file in the playground/ folder.
For example:
<pre>
    cp playground/button.cpp playground/my_test.cpp
</pre>

Then edit this file and add any code you wish.
After adding a new cpp file, just run cmake, so that your new file gets discovered:
<pre>
    cmake .
</pre>

And then compile it:
<pre>
    make
</pre>

After the build, your program should be visible in the <a href="playground/" target="_blank"> build playground folder</a>
