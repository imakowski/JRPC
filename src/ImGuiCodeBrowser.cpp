This is the core of ImGui code.

Usage (extract from [ImGui Readme](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui#usage))

The core of Dear ImGui is self-contained within a few platform-agnostic files which you can easily compile in your application/engine. They are all the files in the root folder of the repository (imgui.cpp, imgui.h, imgui_demo.cpp, imgui_draw.cpp etc.).

No specific build process is required. You can add the .cpp files to your existing project.

You will need a backend to integrate Dear ImGui in your app. The backend passes mouse/keyboard/gamepad inputs and variety of settings to Dear ImGui, and is in charge of rendering the resulting vertices.

Backends for a variety of graphics api and rendering platforms are provided in the [examples/](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples) folder, along with example applications. See the [Integration](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui#integration) section of this document for details. You may also create your own backend. Anywhere where you can render textured triangles, you can render Dear ImGui.
